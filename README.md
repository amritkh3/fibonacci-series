# fibonacci-series
The Fibonacci sequence is a set of integers (the Fibonacci numbers) that starts with a zero, followed by a one, then by another one, and then by a series of steadily increasing numbers. The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.This is my pyhon code which will allow the user to input the end number and print the fibonacci series till the number.
